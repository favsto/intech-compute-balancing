# Google Cloud Storage public files

These are stuffs you should make publicly available into a Google Cloud Storage bucket. 

These files need to be read somwhere in the code. The original bucket had the name "intech", so you have to replace all occurrences like gs://intech/...

Apologize for this non-engineering approach!
